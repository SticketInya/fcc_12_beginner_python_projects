# fcc_12_beginner_python_projects
Going through freeCodeCamp.org's 12 beginner python projects course to solidify what I learnt in a beginner python course.

Closing Thoughts: Just finished the course. There are some fun begginer projects in this course, like hangman and minesweeper, but the overall difficulty curve is all over the place. The instructor doesn't really teach/show the working concept/idea behind the programs before jumping into coding it, thus it's more of a code along than a proper learning opportunity. With that said, I learnt a few useful stuff during this project based course, while having enough fun to continue from project to project. All in all, It's an ok course and theres definitely room for improvement.
